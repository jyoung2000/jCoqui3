# Testing the Coqui TTS Docker Container on Port 2201

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Build the Container
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 2. Start the Container
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify Container is Running
```bash
./verify_container.sh
```

### 4. Manual Testing

#### Check if port 2201 is responding:
```bash
curl http://localhost:2201
```

#### Check health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:2201/health
```

#### Test TTS synthesis via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2201/api/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world!", "language": "en"}'
```

### 5. Browser Access

Open your web browser and navigate to:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:2201
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:2201/health

## Expected Results

✅ **Port 2201**: Web interface loads with modern UI
✅ **Voice Cloning**: Upload area for audio files
✅ **TTS Controls**: Language selection, voice profiles, speed/pitch/volume controls
✅ **File Management**: Generated files list with download buttons
✅ **API Response**: JSON responses from API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Container won't start
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Ensure port 2201 is not already in use
- Verify Docker has enough memory (at least 4GB)

### Port 2201 not responding
- Container may still be initializing (first run downloads models)
- Check container status: `docker-compose ps`
- Wait 30-60 seconds for full initialization

### GPU not detected
- Ensure NVIDIA Docker runtime is installed
- Check GPU availability: `nvidia-smi`
